## Mini Task 1: Build & Explain a Simple Blockchain

### 1. Blockchain Basics

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. 
Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, a reference to the previous block (via its hash), a nonce, and a Merkle root summarizing the transactions. 
This structure ensures that once data is recorded, it becomes immutable and transparent, as altering any block would require changing all subsequent blocks and gaining consensus from the network. 
Blockchain's decentralized nature eliminates the need for a central authority, enhancing security and trust among participants. 
It's the foundational technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and has applications in various sectors due to its ability to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof records.

**Use Cases:**  
Supply Chain Management: Blockchain enhances transparency and traceability in supply chains. For instance, IBM's Food Trust platform uses blockchain to track food products from farm to table, ensuring safety and authenticity. 
Digital Identity: Blockchain provides a secure and unified infrastructure for managing digital identities, reducing fraud and improving user control over personal data.

|        Block Header        |

| Previous Block Hash        |
| Timestamp                  |
| Nonce                      |
| Merkle Root                |
+----------------------------+
|        Block Body          |
+----------------------------+
| Transaction 1              |
| Transaction 2              |
| ...                        |
+----------------------------+

A Merkle tree is a binary tree structure where each leaf node represents the hash of a transaction, and each non-leaf node is the hash of its child nodes. The Merkle root, located at the top of the tree, summarizes all transactions in the block. This structure allows efficient and secure verification of data integrity.

Example: If a block contains four transactions (T1, T2, T3, T4), their hashes (H1, H2, H3, H4) are computed. Then, H1 and H2 are hashed together to form H12, and H3 and H4 to form H34. Finally, H12 and H34 are hashed to produce the Merkle root. If any transaction changes, its hash changes, leading to a different Merkle root, indicating tampering.

### 3. Consensus Mechanisms

#### ðŸ”¨ Proof of Work (PoW) 
Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This process requires significant computational power and energy, ensuring that altering the blockchain is computationally impractical. The energy-intensive nature of PoW is a trade-off for its high level of security.


#### ðŸŒ¿ Proof of Stake (PoS)  
Proof of Stake selects validators based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. Validators are chosen to create new blocks and confirm transactions, receiving rewards in return. PoS is more energy-efficient than PoW, as it doesn't require extensive computational work, and it aligns the interests of validators with the network's health.

#### ðŸ—³ Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)  
Delegated Proof of Stake involves stakeholders voting to elect a small number of delegates who are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain. This system increases efficiency and scalability while maintaining decentralization. Delegates are incentivized to act honestly, as they can be voted out if they fail to perform their duties effectively.
